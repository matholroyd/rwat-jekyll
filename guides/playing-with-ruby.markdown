# Playing with Ruby

To get started, you either need Ruby installed on your computer, or you can go to http://tryruby.org and play with Ruby in the browser. The tryruby.org website has a fantastic tutorial and you can write Ruby code directly in the browser, but is unfortunately a tad slow (at least here in Australia).

If you don't have the patience for tryruby.org, you need Ruby on your computer. Follow the guides for installing Ruby on you computer.

## Interactive Ruby shell

A good place to play and start learning some Ruby is in the interactive Ruby shell.  You can use the shell at tryruby.org, otherwise if you have Ruby installed, open a terminal and type `irb` (**i**nteractive **r**u**b**y shell). 

## Ruby tutorials

If you haven't programmed before, I suggest starting with the tryruby.org tutorial, even though it's a bit slow. It steps you through basic programming concepts that are fairly universal, such as call functions, variables, strings, functions, etc., and will teach you enough Ruby to start playing with Rails.

If you have programmed before, then you should skip to the tutorials at http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/, as well as http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/.
